# Cypress Saucedemo tests

### Description
This project is to showcase my skills with Cypress along with BDD implementation. The website used for this test suite is https://www.saucedemo.com/. In this project I utilize the Page Object Model for my project structure. It makes it easier to maintain, read and resuse code.

This project also has its own reporting. If you run `npm run scripts` a html report will be produce after the tests have been completed.
